'Today you will be exposed to flying in an open cockpit biplane (Stearman) over the beautiful San Tan Mountains, southeast of Phoenix. The Stearman was used as a primary training airplane for most of the pilots during WWII, so you will be learning in an authentic piece of history. We''ll start with a pre-flight inspection followed by an explanation of the radios and controls. We can fly smooth and level if you like, or we can add in some more energetic maneuvers for those that desire a more thrilling experience. Since it''s just you and me, you''ll be invited to take the controls as I give you the same type of instruction that was given to the aviation cadets of WWII. From engine start to return will take approximately 30 minutes.This is a unique experience where you will be exposed to the same type of training that the "Greatest Generation" did during World War II. Flying and training in the Stearman is like traveling back in time over 75 years. This experience would certainly make a most memorable gift for birthdays, weddings, holidays, anniversarys, graduations, or ""just because"". It''s also a great gift for the pilot who has everything.',
'On your GPS, just enter the words "South Avery Circle, Mesa, AZ. After turning onto South Avery Circle, turn right immediately into a small parking lot and I''ll meet you at gate 19. We will depart from the Phoenix-Mesa-Gateway airport and head over to the beautiful San Tan Mountains as you learn how to fly the legendary Stearman biplane. You can wear jeans or shorts (depending on the temperature) along with a t-shirt and closed toe shoes.',
